My research work on Numerai is presented in 

[Robust incremental learning pipelines for temporal tabular datasets with distribution shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07925)
[Dynamic Feature Engineering and model selection methods for temporal tabular datasets with regime changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00790).

I am building machine learning models for the Numerai tournament. Results of models are updated every day on their website. 


### Numerai Models 

The link to the models are in the format of `https://numer.ai/{model_name}`
