# Project Summary 

In my research I have worked on different projects on temporal tabular datasets and time series.  


## GBDT2.0

A customisted LightGBM-based Gradient Boosting Decision Trees models for temporal tabular datasets. 


## DeepLearner2.0

A novel deep learning model for temporal tabular datasets, which complements well with the above GBDT-based models. 


## PortfolioOpt2.0

A new method to combine predictions from machine learning model using well-known theories from finance.
Using the best research results from **both** finance and reinfrocement learning, 
the method can maximise the portfolio return (or minimise the given loss function) within required risk metrics.


## TimeSeriesHybrid 

A new method which combines classical and machine learning techniques for feature engineering and sequence modelling. 
A hybrid approach which demonstrate robust performances for high dimensional time-series.
