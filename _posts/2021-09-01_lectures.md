title: Volatility-based strategies for retail Part 3 
---

The lecture materials is written for undergraduates who want to get an internship at quantitative investing. Those who already done an internship might also found that useful to fill any knowledge gaps (if there are any). The materials is first presented through the Algo Trading society at a university in London in 5 2-hour lectures. Quantopian used to have a good introductory series but since their website went down there is no open source educational materials (to my best knowledge) of that quality. 

What I present here is different from Quantopain/Quant-Connect as they focus on Long/Short Equity. It is written with a focus on Alternative/Global Macro/Long Volatility investing. There is a balance of quantitative methods and financial knowledge. Most of the materials is about risk management and portfolio construction rather than signal generation. It is a review on existing materials though presented in a slightly different way. 

I am planning to write an updating version of the lecture materials which will apply the concepts in this series to build quatiative trading strategies. More original ideas will be included so I have not decided if I want to publish that on Github. If you are a recuiter and interested in these ideas, please contact me through

Why is it different from existing materials? 

- A comprehensive summary written by a postgraduate student. It is easy to find blog articles online on different quantitative finance topics but rarely presented in a comprehensive and coherent way. 
- Program code with the theory are presented in the same notebook. The results can be updated with the most recent data from yfinance, which cannot be done by books published through traditional ways
- I have included the most recent research ideas on Twitter which cannot be found easily in any books. There are many good books but most are written before 2018.
- A different presentation from most standard finance and quantitative trading books. I avoided some topics that are considered canonical in business schools (Mean-Variance Optimisation) but do not really work well in practise. I also decided not to include materials that are very standard (Black-Scholes model) where the existing books would explain the materials better than myself. 
- It is more academic than most materials than you can find online but not technical in a way that only graduate students working in stochastic calculus can understand
- Lightweight and low dependence. We illustrate many strategies using ETFs instead of creating these strategies from the underlying assets to reduce memory and computational resources.
