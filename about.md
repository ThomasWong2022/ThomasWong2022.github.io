### About me

Mathematics PhD student with experiences in quantitative finance, machine learning and data engineering. 
I am an active participant in the quantitative finance competition [Numerai](https://numer.ai/) and other data science competitions on Kaggle.
I also write blog posts about machine learning and finance. 


### Research Interests 

I study machine learning methods for high dimensional datasets, in the context of incremental/transfer learning between datasets with distributional shifts. The main application areas include genomics and finance. As part of my research, I also build machine learning pipelines with robustness and transferability in consideration. 

Examples include:   

- Incremental learning for (temporal) tabular datasets
- Dimensionality reduction methods for sparse datasets (Ex: Matrix Factorisations)
- Feature Engineering methods for time-series (Ex: Signature transforms)
- High Dimensional Regression problems (when p >> N)
- Reinforcement learning for non-stationary problems (Ex: multi-armed bandits)
- Feature clustering with spatial-temporal models 
- AutoML pipelines for temporal tabular and multi-variate time series datasets (Ex. [THOR](https://github.com/ThomasWong2022/thor-public))
