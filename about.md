### About me

Mathematics PhD student with experiences in quantitative finance, machine learning and data engineering. 
I am an active participant in the quantitative finance competition [Numerai](https://numer.ai/) and other data science competitions on Kaggle.
I also write blog posts about machine learning and finance. 


### Research Interests 

I study machine learning methods for high dimensional datasets, in the context of transfer(online) learning between datasets with distributional shifts. The main application areas include genomics and finance. As part of my research, I also build machine learning pipelines with robustness and transferability in consideration. 

Examples include:   

- Incremental learning for (temporal) tabular datasets
- Dimensionality reduction methods for sparse datasets (Ex: Matrix Factorisations)
- Feature Engineering methods for time-series (Ex: Signature transforms)
- Reinforcement learning for non-stationary problems (Ex: multi-armed bandit)
- Feature clustering with spatial-temporal models 
- AutoML pipelines in Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and deep learning
